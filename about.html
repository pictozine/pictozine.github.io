	<h4>In this class students will make small edition, self-published visual books, illustrated pamphlets, pictorial chapbooks, artist’s books, comics and image-based zines. Students will produce self-published small edition books or zines, on their own and collaboratively.  As self-publishing has allowed more personal and self-expressive visual narrative works to be created and distributed, many of which then find homes at traditional publishers, the class will explore self-publishing’s creative and commercial possibilities.</h4>
